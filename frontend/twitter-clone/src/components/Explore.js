On Monday, I injured myself in practice and x-rays showed that I had fractured the fourth metacarpal in my left hand. It was another painful challenge for me. But with the help of my team, I was able to participate in Brussels. 

This was the last competition of the year, and I wanted to end my season on the track. While I couldnâ€™t meet my own expectations, I feel this was a season in which I learned a lot. I am now determined to return, fully fit and ready to go. 

I want to thank all of you for your encouragement. 2024 has made me a better athlete and person. See you in 2025. ðŸ’ª

Jai Hind! ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³`,
